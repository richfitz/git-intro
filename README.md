# Gitting started

## Installation information

[here](installation.md)

## Resources

* [Happy git with R](http://happygitwithr.com) by Jenny Bryan is amazing
* [lessons from last time I taught this](http://nicercode.github.io/2014-02-18-UTS/lessons/70-version-control/) -- material will largely follow this format
* [UBC STAT 545 git instructions](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/git00_index.html)
  - especially [introduction to the shell](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/git09_shell.html)
* [Git in practice](https://github.com/GitInPractice/GitInPractice#readme) comes highly recommended, though I have not read it myself
* [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)'s git lessons
* The [pro git book](https://git-scm.com/documentation) is really nice.  If you work through the first 3 chapters you will know 99% of what you need to know.

## Slides

Uses [reveal-md](http://webpro.github.io/reveal-md/) / [reveal.js](http://webpro.github.io/reveal-md/) and I don't know how to generate a standalone version...

```
sudo npm install -g reveal-md
reveal-md slides.md
```
